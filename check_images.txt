Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
yes,the classifications were as follows:
ResNet : golden retriever
VGG : golden retriever
AlexNet : golden retriever
All models have classified Dog_01.jpg as a "golden retriever".

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the results were: 
Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever (all models) 
Dog_02.jpg: ResNet: blenheim spaniel 
VGG: muzzle 
AlexNet: titi monkey 
So, Dog_02.jpg was classified differently by each model.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all architectures correctly classified these images:
Animal_Name_01.jpg: snake (non dog)
Object_Name_01.jpg: table (non dog)


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:The best model is ResNet, because even though it made mistakes in classifying dog breeds, it achieved:pct_correct_dogs    : 100.00% wich make ResNet unique
